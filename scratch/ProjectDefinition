Possible Project Themes
  Energy and Infrastructure
    Our cities are build on interconnected networks of infrastructure from communications to transportation, 
    utilities to power. Challenges under this theme will leverage data to enable a reliable, efficient, affordable 
    and accessible infrastructure for a better tomorrow

  Our Digital Future
    The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digitalisation by a decade. Challenges under this theme will explore how 
    this acceleration will impact citizens and businesses, and how open data can play a role in our digital future

  Agriculture and the Environment
    Our produce is some of the best in the world. Technologies and enabling services are assisting our primary producers 
    to understand the land and make better decisions. Challenges under this theme will look towards digital agriculture,
    leveraging data to understand how land is used (or whatâ€™s underneath it) and how to best manage our waterways and oceans.

  Health & Wellbeing
    Australia faced an unprecedented year of health and emergency service challenges, including those presented by the global
    COVID-19 pandemic. 

Ideas
  Jamie - Energy and Infrastructure, this theme is very simmilar to my current project which uses blockchain
          to streamline the efficiency of supply chains and the infrustructure of the largest industries in the world.

        - Our Digital Future, this is cool, i recently used ELK stack to make dashboard visualizations of this kinda data
          , we can do some simmilar stuff to make a nice presentation.

  Jonte - it will probably come into it but we should build the idea first though imo (also svm is probably over the top. 
          It just needs to work, not well right?) 

        - Investigate the differences in government spending over constituencies that voted for them and didn't 
          (like for pork barelling or whatever)

  Jason - Maybe get the data and then use keras/tensorflow(/ELK stack too) to build models and make some prediction on something.  


Argument / Discusscusion (bc we need to decide on a theme/project)

  Maninndra - Can we include machine learning? SVM?
    - No it needs to be good idiot, how will we win otherwise? We're comepeting against the neckbeards here. 
    Jonte - the project will not be marked on the quality of the implementation, rather the idea. The difference between svm and normal classification is small enough that it won't effect anything (imo)

  - Like we're doing data analysis right. Not creating any software. 46 hours aret enough
    ^^ not rlly sure what this is saying, pls rephrase.


Roles:




Notes:

- Take notes of the datasets used
- prototype on Sat
- The project page is what gets submitted
- Attach an open source license (none specfically)
- 7pm Sat
    - Livestream Trivia
- Finalise project by Sunday and publish it to the project page
- Include an video, Screenshots, 
- Github
- Sunday 5pm Australian Eastern time is the due date. 


Challenges 
International
- Health and wellbeing of Disabled and Austisic people
- Living in a post-pandemic world 
Australian:
- Exploring the national skills commisions's Australian Skills classification
- Our finacial future 

- Youth Employment 
- Create a solution to a customer need using ABS Data API

Tesltra:
- Harness to enable local agricultural buisnesses to be more effcient and productive. Especially in terms of enviromental changes like
global warming
- IOT (Internet of Things), Smart tractors, Temperature monitors, Tesltra network etc...
- Pair these devices with open data to make solutions to improve farmers with their practices



ACT challenges:

- The future of transportation
  Jonte - we could do some analysis on congestion with geospatial data https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/

Jonte - potentially we could look at how we can reduce car infastructure and increase public transport
  Jonte - we could look at how lockdown (online work) has affect how people transport around. 
  - Looking at how traffic has changed during lockdown and fires and correlating it to environmental data- The electric Vehicle future
  ^^ nah everyones gonna do that, not unique at all
